# THPS-THPG any% leaderboard
This is a leaderboard for the main/default any% catagories for all of the 9 mainline neversoft tony hawk games.
It uses a bash script to call speedrun.com's api and then runs that through a python script that then spits out a leaderboard as a .html file.

## Why was this made?
I wanted to learn the speedrun.com API and I like stats lol.
